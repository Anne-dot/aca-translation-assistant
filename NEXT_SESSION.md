## 🎯 Next Session: Start Implementation

**Issue #21 - Data Pipeline Implementation**
- Link: https://github.com/Anne-dot/aca-translation-assistant/issues/21

- Review CSV structure together
- Discuss parsing logic
- Test with 5-10 sample rows
- Then full extraction (334 terms)

**Approach:**
- Step-by-step with user discussion
- No assumptions without asking
- Test small before running full
- Document decisions as we go
