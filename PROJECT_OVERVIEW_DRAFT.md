# ACA Translation Assistant - Project Overview (DRAFT)

## Mission & Dream

Build a tool that helps all smaller and bigger ACA communities translate ACA material into their native language, even when they lack resources - small communities, few volunteers, limited financial support, unsustainable book sales, changing team members.

**Base materials:** ACA WSO (World Service Organization) official publications

**Official Guidelines (Downloaded 2025-10-14):**
- Translation-Process-Guidelines.pdf
- Guidelines-for-Translations.pdf
- Location: `aca_official_guidelines/`

**Why this matters:**
ACA WSO guidelines emphasize that glossary/terminology database is the FIRST and MANDATORY step before translating any literature. Terms must be translated CONSISTENTLY across all documents. This tool follows WSO's recommended workflow.

**Current Focus:**
Estonian ACA/ATL materials - building a systematic terminology database as the foundation.
