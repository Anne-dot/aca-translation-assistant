abandonment (n)	A state of being in which your physical and/or emotional needs for love, care, and support have not been met.

Both of my parents were too busy with work to give their children the love and attention we needed.		"BRB pp.11, 27-29, 370

N: neglect for further references in the literature "	A form of child abuse, where the caregivers consistently fail to meet the physical and/or emotional needs of a child. These needs include food, shelter, clothing, medical care, adequate supervision, education, socialization, nurturing, and affection. Childhood neglect can have lasting negative cognitive, emotional, and physical effects on the child.  				childhood abandonment		Physical neglect can be easier to identify, for example if a parent does not give their child enough food to eat or appropriate clothes to wear.

The phrase childhood trauma can also refer to the negative effects these experiences can have on a child. Examples of childhood trauma include: emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, childhood neglect, and bullying. Witnessing violence against others can also cause childhood trauma, as can war, racism, poverty, and systemic oppression.

They listen to what every person has to say and always put the group conscience above their own personal beliefs or wishes. They only give their opinion when asked.

Examples of this include consistently ignoring the victim, setting unrealistic expectations, and gaslighting.  Studies have shown emotional abuse is just as damaging as physical abuse. 		psychological abuse		The emotional abuse in my childhood was very damaging, because the constant criticism, name-calling, and unrealistic expectations of me destroyed my self-esteem.

In the fellow traveler model of ACA, the people working together are considered equals. They help each other on a peer-to-peer basis, rather than one person being a teacher or authority figure. This approach is considered necessary for many adult children, to avoid repeating the dysfunctional behavior and unhealthy power dynamic of our families of origin.

one’s self *, oneself (pronoun)			"A reflexive pronoun which refers back to the subject of a sentence. It is used to replace the pronouns herself or himself, in situations where the speaker/writer does not want to assign gender to the subject. It can also be used in more formal language to refer back to the speaker. In this case it replaces the pronoun myself. This pronoun is also sometimes used to emphasize that the subject did something alone, without the help of others.
*In the past, one’s self and oneself were sometimes both used to mean the gender-neutral, third person reflexive pronoun (see usage example sentence). However, in Standard modern English, one’s self and oneself are two different words, with different meanings. According to the context, the writers of the Big Red Book most likely intended to use the word one’s self as a reflexive pronoun, which is now usually written as one word - oneself. When translating one’s self in ACA literature, it is suggested to use the standard definition of oneself as it appears in this glossary.

A sponsor typically has more time and experience in ACA, and has completed the Steps.

They generally do not give advice or tell the sponsee what to do. They actively listen, reflect back what they are hearing, help present healthy alternatives to dysfunction, and share what they did in similar situations. Being a sponsor is an important part of later recovery, where we continue our own spiritual growth by guiding another person through the earlier stages of recovery. 		mentor, peer support		My sponsor guided me through the Twelve Steps, sharing their own experience, strength, and hope.

In ACA, it is a partnership of equals, not a teacher-student relationship. This is a difference to other 12 Step programs. A peer-to-peer relationship works better for adult children, because they often struggle with authority figures.		peer-to-peer help with ACA recovery		Sponsorship is beneficial to both people in the relationship.

stuck grief (n) – see also G: grief, L: loss		Feelings of loss and abandonment, as a result of childhood trauma, neglect, and abuse. We were unable to safely express these emotions as children in a dysfunctional family, so they stayed with us. While me may have the memory of the specific events that resulted in loss, the accompanying emotions are trapped behind denial, fear, and our own defense mechanisms. These keep us numb and disconnected from our true emotions. Stuck grief remains with us, sometimes making itself known as physical pain, illness, and/or depression, until we arrive in a safe space such as ACA. There we can finally feel the feelings and release them as they arrive.		stored grief, repressed feelings of loss and abandonment		I released a lot of stuck grief when I did my Step Four trauma and abandonment inventories.
