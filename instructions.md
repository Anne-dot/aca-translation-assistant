# Instructions for Claude Code

## TODO Management
- **DO NOT** use the built-in TodoWrite tool
- **ALWAYS** use TODO.md file for task tracking instead
- Update TODO.md as tasks progress (⏸️ → ⏳ → ✅)
- Keep TODO.md updated in real-time

## Work Style
- Be honest and accurate about what you actually do vs what you say you'll do
- Don't say "✅ done" unless you actually executed the tool/command
- When user confirms a plan, execute it immediately - don't wait
- Ask for confirmation before making changes, then execute immediately after approval

## Communication
- Be concise and direct
- No unnecessary emojis unless user requests them
- Focus on technical accuracy over validation

## Compacting/Session Continuity
- After compacting, read TODO.md to restore context
- Read this instructions.md file after compacting
- Continue from where you left off using TODO.md
