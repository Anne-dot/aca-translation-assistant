# Terminology Database Milestone M1: Critical Review and Open Issues

## Document provenance

- **How it was created:** Using Google NotebookLM AI chatbot (chat feature) with a structured prompt asking for open questions and recommendations grouped by M1 priority.
- **Source materials (13 sources in notebook):** Project documentation (JSON_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATION.md, TBX_vs_MY_PLANS.md, TBX-Basic_FIELDS.md, TBX-Basic standard PDF), GitHub issues (#13, #14, #44), and 6 audio episodes (deep dives and critiques) generated by NotebookLM covering the TBX standard and project architecture.

Based on the provided documents and expert critiques, the following items remain open or require human review before the Terminology Database milestone (M1) can be considered complete.

## MUST decide before M1

### TBX Standard Compliance Audit

- **What is unclear or undecided:** Issue 44, which focuses on a deep-dive review of the TBX standard to ensure decisions are informed by requirements, is currently marked as **OPEN**. While Decision 18 claims 100% compliance, critics note that custom objects like `workflow` and `_metadata` must be verified against the TBX Basic specification to determine if they are legally permitted or if they should be mapped to standard fields like `projectSubset`.
- **Why it matters:** Locking in architecture without verifying the "building code" risks creating a **proprietary island**; professional CAT tools (like Trados or memoQ) may reject the files or silently scrub custom metadata during import.

### Atomic Concept Architecture for Components

- **What is unclear or undecided:** Decision 17 (Part 4) currently stores dictionary lookups for component terms (e.g. "inventory") within the **metadata of the parent concept** (e.g. "blameless inventory"). This violates the TBX principle of atomicity, where definition data should belong to the specific concept it defines.
- **Why it matters:** This structure makes the database non-scalable. For example, a Finnish or Slovak translation of a single component cannot be easily added if that component is "held hostage" inside an English parent entry. It creates a "single source of confusion" for external machine readers.
- **Relevant sources:** `Custom_Data_Breaks_TBX_Interoperability.m4a`, `JSON_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATION.md`.

### Automated Status Synchronisation

- **What is unclear or undecided:** The system currently maintains dual status tracking: the standard `administrativeStatus` and the custom `workflow` object. It is undecided if the system will implement **rigid, unidirectional automated inheritance** to ensure that human updates to a workflow status (e.g. "rejected") automatically trigger the correct standard status update (e.g. "deprecated").
- **Why it matters:** Relying on humans to manually update parallel status fields leads to **data desynchronisation**. A term could be marked "rejected" in the workflow while remaining "preferred" in the standard field, leading translators to use incorrect terms.

## SHOULD decide before M1

### Data Quality Gate for Part of Speech

- **What is unclear or undecided:** Decision 6 makes `partOfSpeech` optional for Phase 1 but required for Phase 3. Experts recommend running a **pilot extraction** of approximately 50 terms immediately to measure the failure rate of the source data before proceeding.
- **Why it matters:** If the error rate (null values) is too high (e.g. over 10%), the project will accrue significant "data debt," potentially causing the migration script to crash in Phase 3 and halting development while teams manually edit hundreds of entries.
- **Relevant sources:** `Fixing_Logic_Flaws_in_ACA_Translation_Schema.m4a`, `issue-14-json-schema.md`.

### Linguistic vs Structural Conflict Resolution

- **What is unclear or undecided:** There is a logic collision between Decision 17 (mechanical word count determines complexity) and Decision 6 (grammatical part of speech). For a term like "at ease", the system tags it as "complex" due to the space, yet it is grammatically a "phrase". A definitive **hierarchy of definition** is needed to determine how the validator handles these overlaps.
- **Why it matters:** Without clear rules, the schema produces **data noise**. It remains undecided if the validator should throw an error or allow these states to coexist, leaving the decision to developers rather than linguists.
- **Relevant sources:** `Custom_Data_Breaks_TBX_Interoperability.m4a`, `Fixing_Logic_Flaws_in_ACA_Translation_Schema.m4a`.

### Component Sync Directionality

- **What is unclear or undecided:** While the schema explains how data flows from parent to child, it does not define **reverse synchronisation**. It must be decided if child components are "read-only" or if local edits should trigger a "needs refresh" flag in a transaction log.
- **Why it matters:** Without a sync strategy, a user could edit a component definition locally without updating the master record, creating a **"multiverse of truths"** where different entries for the same word have conflicting definitions.
- **Relevant sources:** `Fixing_Logic_Flaws_in_ACA_Translation_Schema.m4a`.

## CAN defer to M2

### Export Degradation Strategy

- **What is unclear or undecided:** The specific mapping of custom fields (like `addedReason` or `termComplexity`) into standard `note` or `description` fields for export has been suggested but not formalised in the script logic.
- **Why it matters:** While not a blocker for M1 database entry, the lack of a strategy means essential committee context will "vanish" when the data is opened in standard terminology software.
- **Relevant sources:** `Custom_Data_Breaks_TBX_Interoperability.m4a`.

### Structural Complexity Naming

- **What is unclear or undecided:** There is a recommendation to rename the custom field `termComplexity` to **`structuralComplexity`** to more accurately reflect its word-count-based logic rather than grammatical difficulty.
- **Why it matters:** This provides better semantic clarity for users and developers, distinguishing mechanical space-counting from linguistic tags.
